#### Basics of Quantifier Negation

- <span class="btb">Negating Universal Quantifier</span>:
  - **Equivalence**: <span class="ortb">¬∀xP(x)</span> is equivalent to <span class="ortb">∃x¬P(x)</span>.
  - **Interpretation**: If not every element (x) has property P, then there exists an element that does not have property P.

- <span class="btb">Negating Existential Quantifier</span>:
  - **Equivalence**: <span class="ortb">¬∃xP(x)</span> is equivalent to <span class="ortb">∀x¬P(x)</span>.
  - **Interpretation**: If there does not exist an element with property P, then all elements do not have property P.

#### Understanding the Switch

- <span class="btb">Quantifier Type Switch</span>: 
  - **Process**: Passing the negation symbol over a quantifier switches its type.
  - **Rationale**: This reflects logical consistency in terms of existence and universality.
  
- <span class="btb">Logical Implications</span>:
  - **Universal to Existential**: If <span class="gtb">not everything</span> has a property, it logically follows that <span class="gtb">something</span> does not have that property.
  - **Existential to Universal**: If <span class="gtb">there is not something</span> with a property, it means <span class="gtb">everything</span> lacks that property.
