A <span class="btb">logical conclusion</span> consists of a set of statements {X1, ..., Xn}, the <span class="btb">premises</span>, which are assumed to be <span class="gtb">true</span>, and another statement Y, the <span class="btb">conclusion</span>, whose truth necessarily follows from the premises.

Known rules of conclusion are: 
<span class="btb">Modus Ponens</span>: If X and X ⇒ Y are <span class="gtb">true</span>, then Y is also <span class="gtb">true</span>. 
<span class="btb">Modus Tollens</span>: If ¬Y and X ⇒ Y are <span class="gtb">true</span>, then ¬X is also <span class="gtb">true</span>. 
<span class="btb">Chain Conclusion</span>: If X ⇒ Y and Y ⇒ Z are <span class="gtb">true</span>, then X ⇒ Z is also <span class="gtb">true</span>.
