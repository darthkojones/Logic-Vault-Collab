#### Understanding Implicit Universal Quantification

- <span class="btb">General Convention</span>:
  - **Precision vs. Convention**: In mathematics, precision is key, but sometimes, conventions allow for a relaxed approach.
  - **Implicit Quantification**: Sentences with predicates containing free variables are often intended as statements with an implicit universal quantification.

#### Example Analysis

- <span class="btb">Square and Rectangle Predicates</span>:
  - **Predicates**: <span class="ortb">S(x): "x is a square"</span>, <span class="ortb">R(x): "x is a rectangle"</span>.
  - **Initial Sentence**: <span class="ortb">S(x) → R(x)</span> is not a statement by itself as it contains a free variable 'x'.

- <span class="btb">Implicit Universal Quantification</span>:
  - **Convention Applied**: By convention, <span class="ortb">S(x) → R(x)</span> is understood as <span class="ortb">∀x(S(x) → R(x))</span>.
  - **Interpretation**: This universally quantified statement asserts that "for all x, if x is a square, then x is a rectangle."

#### Predicate vs. Statement

- <span class="btb">Sloppy Distinction</span>:
  - **Common Practice**: Often, the distinction between a predicate and a statement is not strictly adhered to in casual mathematical discussions.
  - **Example**: Saying "let P(n) be the statement, 'n is prime'," is technically incorrect but understood.
  - **Implicit Understanding**: It's implicitly understood that P(n) is a predicate, which becomes a statement when applied to a specific 'n'.

#### Conclusion

- <span class="btb">Conventional Understanding</span>:
  - While precise terminology is important, conventions allow for understanding implicit quantifiers in statements involving predicates with free variables.
