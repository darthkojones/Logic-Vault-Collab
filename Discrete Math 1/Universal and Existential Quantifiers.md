#### Existential Quantifier

- <span class="btb">Symbol</span>: The existential quantifier is denoted by <span class="ortb">∃</span>.
- <span class="btb">Reading</span>: It is read as <span class="gtb">"there exists"</span> or <span class="gtb">"there is"</span>.
- <span class="btb">Usage Example</span>:
  - <span class="ortb">∃x(x < 0)</span>
  - Interpretation: This asserts that <span class="gtb">there is a number less than 0</span>.

#### Universal Quantifier

- <span class="btb">Symbol</span>: The universal quantifier is represented by <span class="ortb">∀</span>.
- <span class="btb">Reading</span>: It is read as <span class="gtb">"for all"</span> or <span class="gtb">"every"</span>.
- <span class="btb">Usage Example</span>:
  - <span class="ortb">∀x(x ≥ 0)</span>
  - Interpretation: This asserts that <span class="gtb">every number is greater than or equal to 0</span>.

#### Understanding Quantifiers

- <span class="btb">Function</span>: 
  - Existential quantifiers are used to express that <span class="gtb">at least one element</span> in the domain satisfies a given property.
  - Universal quantifiers express that <span class="gtb">all elements</span> in the domain satisfy a certain property.
