<span class="lsgtb">P ↔ Q</span> is logically equivalent to <span class="lsgtb">(P → Q) ∧ (Q → P)</span>. 

Example: 

Given an integer n, it is <span class="gtb">true</span> that n is even if and only if n² is even. 
That is, if n is even, then n² is even, as well as the converse: if n² is even, then n is even.
