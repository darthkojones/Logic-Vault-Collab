To prove an implication P → Q, it is enough to assume P, and from it, deduce Q

Perhaps a better way to say this is that to prove a statement of the form P → Q directly, you must explain why Q is true, but you get to assume P is true first. After all, you only care about whether Q is true in the case that P is as well

Suppose the numbers a and b are even. 
This means that a = 2k and b = 2j for some integers k and j. 
The sum is then a + b = 2k + 2j = 2(k + j). 
Since k + j is an integer, this means that a + b is even.
