An <span class="lsgtb">implication</span> or <span class="lsgtb">conditional</span> is a <span class="ortb">molecular</span><span class="btb"> statement</span> of the form
												&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="lsgtb">P <span class="lsgtb">→</span> Q </span> 
where P and Q are <span class="btb"> statements</span>. 

We say that:
	• P is the <span class="btb">hypothesis</span> (or <span class="btb">antecedent</span>). 
	• Q is the <span class="btb">conclusion</span> (or <span class="btb">consequent</span>). 

An implication is <span class="gtb">true</span> provided P is <span class="rtb">false</span> or Q is <span class="gtb">true</span> (or both), and <span class="rtb">false</span> otherwise. 
In particular, the only way for <span class="lsgtb">P <span class="lsgtb">→</span> Q </span> to be <span class="rtb">false</span> is for P to be <span class="gtb">true</span> and Q to be <span class="rtb">false</span>.
