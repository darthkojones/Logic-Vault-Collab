A <span class="btb">statement</span> is any declarative sentence which is either <span class="gtb">true</span> or <span class="rtb">false</span>.
A statement is <span class="btb">atomic</span> if it <span class="rtb">cannot</span> be divided into smaller statements,
otherwise it is called <span class="ortb">molecular</span>.
