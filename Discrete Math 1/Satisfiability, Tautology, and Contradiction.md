- **<span class="btb">Satisfiability</span>**: A statement <span class="btb">x</span> is called <span class="gtb">satisfiable</span> if there is at least one truth value assignment of the atomic statements in <span class="btb">x</span> that makes <span class="btb">x</span> true.
- **<span class="btb">Contradiction</span>**: <span class="btb">x</span> is called a <span class="rtb">contradiction</span> (or <span class="rtb">unsatisfiable</span>), if there is no truth value assignment of the atomic statements in <span class="btb">x</span> that makes <span class="btb">x</span> true.
- **<span class="btb">Tautology</span>**: <span class="btb">x</span> is called a <span class="gtb">tautology</span>, if for all truth value assignments of the atomic statements in <span class="btb">x</span>, <span class="btb">x</span> is true.

#### Tips for Memorizing Truth Table Concepts

- A <span class="btb">tautology</span> is a statement that's always <span class="gtb">true</span>, like a universal truth. It's like saying "either it will rain, or it won't."
- A <span class="btb">contradiction</span> is a statement that's always <span class="rtb">false</span>, like saying "it's raining and not raining at the same time."
- <span class="btb">Satisfiability</span> means there's at least one scenario where the statement holds <span class="gtb">true</span>. It's like saying "there might be days when it rains."
