While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls guarding a bridge. 
Each is either a knight, who always tells the truth, or a knave, who always lies. 
The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave. 
Each troll makes a single statement: 

1. Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here. 
2. Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying. 
3. Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight. 

 Which troll is which?
