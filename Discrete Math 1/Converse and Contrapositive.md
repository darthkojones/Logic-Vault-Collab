• The <span class="lsgtb">converse</span> of an implication <span class="lsgtb">P <span class="lsgtb">→</span> Q </span> is the implication 
<span class="lsgtb">Q <span class="lsgtb">→</span>P</span>. 
The <span class="lsgtb">converse</span> is <span class="rtb">NOT</span> logically equivalent to the original
implication. That is, whether the converse of an implication is
<span class="gtb">true</span> is independent of the truth of the implication.




• The <span class="lsgtb">contrapositive</span> of an implication <span class="lsgtb">P <span class="lsgtb">→</span> Q </span> is the statement
<span class="rtb">¬Q</span> <span class="lsgtb">→</span> <span class="rtb">¬P</span>. 
An implication and its <span class="lsgtb">contrapositive</span> are logically
equivalent (they are either both <span class="gtb">true</span> or both <span class="rtb">false</span>).
