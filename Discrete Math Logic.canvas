For this problem, take P to mean “Sue gets a 93% on her final” and Q to mean “Sue will get an A in the class.”\n1. We have P → Q and P, so Q follows. Sue gets an A.\n2. You cannot conclude anything.

What would happen if Sue does not get an A but did get a 93% on the final? Then P would be true and Q would be false. This makes the implication P → Q false!

To find |A|, we count the number of elements from 3 to 15, which is 13 because 15 - 3 = 12, plus 1 since we include the starting number.\n    - (b) <span class=\"lsgtb\">B={n∈N:2<n≤200}</span>.

This set is describing odd numbers (2m + 1 is always odd) up to 100. Since every second number in a sequence of natural numbers is odd, half of the 100 numbers will be odd, giving us 50.\n2. To find two sets A and B with the given cardinalities where |A∪B|=9, we need to consider that the union of two sets contains all the unique elements from both. Since |A|=5, |B|=6, and |A∪B|=9, it means there are 2 elements common to both sets (because 5 + 6 = 11, but there are only 9 unique elements when combined). So, |A∩B|=2.\n    \n3. To find sets A and B where |A|=|B|, |A∪B|=7, and |A∩B|=3, we use similar logic. Since the intersection has 3 elements, and the union has 7, that means there are 4 unique elements in each set not in the intersection. Since |A|=|B|, each set must have 4 unique elements plus the 3 in the intersection, making |A|=|B|=7-3=4+3=7.\n    \n4. For set A={1,2,...,10}, B2 is the set of all subsets of A with exactly 2 elements. To find |B2|, we use the combination formula C(n,k)=k!(n-k)!n! where n is the number of elements to choose from (in this case 10), and k is the number we want to choose (in this case 2). This gives us C(10,2)=2!(10−2)!10!=2!×8!×10!=9×45.\n    \n5. For the sets A={1,2,3} and B={2,3,4}, AB is the set where each element is the product of an element from A and an element from B. So, AB={2,3,4,4,6,8}, but since we are looking for unique products, |AB|={2,3,4,6,8} which gives us 5. However, there is a mistake in the previous response; the unique elements after multiplication would actually be |AB|=3, considering the set AB={2,4,6,8} (since 1x2 and 2x2 both give 4, it is not counted twice). For the Cartesian product A×B, we list all possible ordered pairs, giving us 6 pairs: {(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4)} {(1,2),(2,3),(1,3),(4,2),(2,3),(2,4)}, thus |A×B|=6.","x":23060,"y":3774,"width":1020,"height":1009,"color":"5"},
